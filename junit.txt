JUnit project uses the Google Java Style (https://github.com/google/styleguide) for all new
indentation is 5 spaces instead of 3.
Be sure to set text file encoding to UTF-8 and line delimiters to UNIX style.
Since not all code has been formatted yet, please format only code lines you changed to avoid extraneous changes.
Legacy code (under junit.*) used the legacy guide specified in LEGACY_CODING_STYLE.txt in the
project.
